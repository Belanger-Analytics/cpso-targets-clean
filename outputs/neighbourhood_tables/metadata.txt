DESCRIPTION OF FOLDER CONTENTS

This folder contains the current final outputs of the travel analysis, and a set of older results for comparison. The new results are based on a smaller set of family physiciasn based on revisions from ONS and community expertise.

The results consist of two tables, one for diving and one for walking, that show neighbourhood-level population-weighted average travel distances and times to family physicians. 

Each table contains two sets of results:
  * Those for the general population traveling to any family physician, and 
  * Those for French-only speakers to French-speaking family physicians.

Current results:
  * ons_table_auto_rurality.csv
  * ons_table_walk_rurality.csv

Old results for comparison are in the /archive/ folder:
  * ons_table_auto_rurality_old.csv
  * ons_table_walk_rurality_old.csv
